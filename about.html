                Our mission is to design a seamless and student-friendly finance 
                tracker that simplifies budgeting, tracks expenses, and offers actionable 
                insights tailored to limited and irregular incomes. We aim to help students 
                build healthier financial habits while balancing their studies, work, and 
                everyday responsibilities.
